# Galerie - a photo sharing learning project

A fullstack repository to understand how to deploy a serverless infra on AWS, host a React app on S3, spin up a Postgres instance on AWS RDS and monitor everything with logs.
The app is a simple photo sharing app, where you can upload your photos and share a link with your friends for future download.
