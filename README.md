# Galerie - a personal photo storage app

A fullstack project to understand how to deploy a serverless infra on AWS, host a React app on S3 and monitor everything with logs.
The app is a simple photo storage app where you can upload photos, add a title and a description to them and see them in a gallery.

## TODO

- [x] Create a S3 bucket for hosting the React app + add a CloudFront distribution
- [ ] Create a S3 bucket for storing the photos
- [ ] Create a DynamoDB table for storing the photos metadata
- [ ] Create a Lambda function that will handle the server logic
- [ ] Think about authentication to restrict the app access to only friends and family
